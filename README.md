# PyBer_Analysis
Conducting rideshare data analysis using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib.

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis was conducted to show the total weekly ride fares for each city type in the data: urban, suburban, and rural. These are the city types in which PyBer collected data on for its drivers and riders. We delivered data showing a ride-sharing summary in part 1 of the analysis and a line plot by city type in part 2 of the analysis. For this challenge, we also created a summary data frame that showed total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver along with the aformentioned line plot.

## Results
As you can see below in the summary graphic, the higher population area (urban) had considerably more total rides than lesser populated areas like suburban and rural. The average fare per driver is also lower in urban areas likely due to the more frequent and lesser distance rides that are ordered by Pyber riders. For instance, the average fare per driver is $16.57 per driver in urban areas and $55.48 per driver in rural areas. Rural area riders demand fewer but longer riders while urban riders demand more rides in total with lesser distances in the urban core.
