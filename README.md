# PyBer_Analysis
Conducting rideshare data analysis using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib.

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis was conducted to show the total weekly ride fares for each city type in the data: urban, suburban, and rural. These are the city types in which PyBer collected data on for its drivers and riders. We delivered data showing a ride-sharing summary in part 1 of the analysis and a line plot by city type in part 2 of the analysis. For this challenge, we also created a summary data frame that showed total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver along with the aformentioned line plot.

## Results
As you can see below in the summary graphic, the higher population area (urban) had considerably more total rides than lesser populated areas like suburban and rural. The average fare per driver is also lower in urban areas likely due to the more frequent and lesser distance rides that are ordered by Pyber riders. For instance, the average fare per driver is $16.57 per driver in urban areas and $55.48 per driver in rural areas. Rural area riders demand fewer but longer riders while urban riders demand more rides in total with lesser distances in the urban core.

There seems to be a considerable uptick in every city type during the month of April as you can see below. All 3 city types experienced higher revenue during the month of April. Urban rides are our bread and butter as the revenue generated from this type is much higher than the other 2 types. Overall, we see similar trends among the urban, suburban. and rural city types from the graph below.

## Summary
I'd recommend decreasing the number of drivers on the road in urban areas. This would theoretically drive down supply of drivers to increase overall prices which would benefit both PyBer and the drivers in the urban areas. We would still see large number of rides ordered on our app. 

Another recommendation would be to increase our driver pool on the road in the month of April to maximize rides and thus profits. Our data showed an uptick in all rides ordered in April by all 3 city types we have data for. 

To conclude, I'd look to run specials to drive activity in the suburbs. Our data shows an average fare per ride of $30.97 as well an avg. fare per driver of $39.50 (tipping is good in this city type). Both our app and drivers profit considerably in the suburbs.
