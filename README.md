# PyBer_Analysis
Conducting rideshare data analysis using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib.

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis was conducted to show the total weekly ride fares for each city type in the data: urban, suburban, and rural. These are the city types in which PyBer collected data on for its drivers and riders. We delivered data showing a ride-sharing summary in part 1 of the analysis and a line plot by city type in part 2 of the analysis. For this challenge, we also created a summary data frame that showed total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver along with the aformentioned line plot.
